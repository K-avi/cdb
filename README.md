# Composition DataBase (CDB)

- is a side project I'm doing during my summer internship at LIP6/Inria. 
- it's goal is to be a somewhat efficient C implementation of the database backend model described in [S.Haatia's thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04291337/document).
- I might not respect all of the specifications of the backend but I'll try to stay close from it.

## My goals are

- To reimplement the backend in C
- To implement a somewhat convenient way of doing "compositions" 
- To benchmark the code compare it to other db's and make nice plots (performance isn't the *main* concern but **some** performance would be welcome)
