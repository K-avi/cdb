# Composition DataBase (CDB)

    - is a side project I'm doing during my summer internship at LIP6/Inria. 
    - it's goal is to be a somewhat efficient C implementation of the database backend model described in S.Haatia's thesis ( see: https://theses.hal.science/tel-04291337/document ). 
    - I might not respect all of the specifications of the backend but I'll try to stay close from it.

## My goals are

    - To reimplement the backend in C 
    - To implement a somewhat convenient way of doing "compositions" 
    - To benchmark the code and compare it to other db (performance isn't the *main* concern but some performance would be welcome)
