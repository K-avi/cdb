Tests : 
    - done atm


Implementation : 
    - Map is first 
        - Hash bucket should be linked list w atomic pointers at the bucket level actually 


should i use a 
mapbucket** for the bucket list in the map 
idk 
on the one hand it fucks up mem proximity and stuff 
on the other hand it makes my life easier 
and enables efficient head insert 

tbh now that I think about it, the best implem is prolly 
a linked list of static arrays 

fuck 



TODO : 
    - muti threaded and acid compliant journal / map 
        - LWW policy 
    - transaction module
    - keep in mind the implem has to be as modular as possible for composition's sake  
    - custom allocator (if I want to make smtg scalable I WILL have to use this)
