Tests : 
    - done atm

the map should maintain some kind of linked list at each bucket for timestamps or smtg 
I completely forgot about that 
Why do I even need those smh 
Implementation : 
    - Map is first 
        - test map primitives (locks are so much easier than atomics)

should i use a 
mapbucket** for the bucket list in the map 
idk 
on the one hand it fucks up mem proximity and stuff 
on the other hand it makes my life easier 
and enables efficient head insert 

tbh now that I think about it, the best implem is prolly 
a linked list of static arrays 

fuck 



TODO : 
    - muti threaded and acid compliant journal / map 
        - LWW policy 
    - transaction module
    - keep in mind the implem has to be as modular as possible for composition's sake  
    - custom allocator (if I want to make smtg scalable I WILL have to use this)
